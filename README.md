# hello-world
I'm Ciprian 31 years old, 
from Romania, I'm an Italian chef,
I'm interested in tec.
I'm impressed by where humanity arrived so far.
I would like tu learn mor about computers and their future,
in my opinion in the future we wil be surrounded by robots(we are already now in a way).
If I will see that I will like more this then cooking, I will change my job,
if not, I will have learned somthing interesting :)
